## Vscode Theme

Currently in beta or something idk.

## Installing the theme

Download the .vsix file and under the `...` at the extensions section at the top you'll get a menu. Click on `Install from .vsix` and click the .vsix file.

For any issues or anything feel free to open an issue or whatever

Anyway, peace
